## Introduction 

Image segmentation segments a digital image based on a certain characteristic of the pixels is a well-known technique. The goal is to turn a grayscale image into a binary image, classifying each pixel into one of two categories, such as "dark" or "white". The most basic threshold technique is to choose a threshold value and compare each pixel to that value. Starting of this principle, many of thresholding methods have been developed. Among them, there are two main categories :  global thresholding, where a single threshold is used throughout the image to be divided into two classes and local thresholding, where the threshold values are determined locally, pixel by pixel or region by region. Three of four algorithm that will be presented Otsu, K-means and Entropie are part of the global thresholding category and are histogram based-methods. While the fourth algorithm, adaptive threshold is part of the local thresholding category and is based on the used of a kernel that runs through the image.

## Materiel and methods

### K-means 

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, it is one of the most popular method for cluster analysis. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. k is set by the observer. 

The method has been adapted to automatic thresholding : each cluster will represent one side of a threshold. Choosing 2 clusters (k=2) will result in a bilevel thresholding. Choosing 3 or more will result in a multilevel thresholding. The mean of each cluster is usually called a "centroid".

Programm summary:

1. Initialization of k-numbers of random centroids.
2. Create k-numbers of cluster by labeling each pixel of the image with its closest centroid.
3. Compute the mean of each cluster to create brand new k-numbers of centroids.
4. Label each pixel with its closest new centroid and confront them to the old labels :
    If the old and new labels are exactly the same, stop the loop.
    Else, new labels supersede old labels then repeat steps 3 and 4.
5. Each pixel take the value of its closest centroid. If k=2, each pixel can become black or white.

### Adaptive threshold

Adaptive thresholding is the common solution that takes order to account for variations in illumination. The main difference with the other techniques is that a different threshold value is computed for each pixel in the image. This makes this technique more robust to variations in image illumination. 

The algorithm which creates a binary image uses the integral image tool to perform the calculations. it allow to compute the sum over multiple overlapping rectangular windows and achieve a constant number of operations per rectangle with only a linear amount of preprocessing. The algorithm contains several steps : 

1. Computation of the integral image.

To compute the integral image, the sum of all f(x,y) terms to the left and above the pixels(x,y) is store at each location ,I(x,y) using the following equation 1 :

    <center><figcaption>Equation of integral image.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

In practice, a pixel of the integral image I(x,y) is calculated from the sum of the pixels of the image above f(x, yi) added to the left pixel of the previously calculated integral image such that I (x-1,y). 
At the same time the thresholding step at pixel is compute.

2. Computation kernel coordinates.
3. Computation the area of kernel.
4. Computation the sum of the pixels visited by the kernel.

the sum of the the pixel visited by the kernel is compute using the following equation :

    <center><figcaption>Equation of the sum of all pixel present in the kernel</figcaption></center>
</figure>

5. Determination the pixel value.

To determine the pixel value of the binary image, the product of the pixel value of the input image and the area of kernel is compared to the product of the sum of the pixels of the kernel with value given by the user to modulate this sum value. If the first product is lower than the second or equal the value of the pixel will be 0 and vice versa of 255.
 
 ### Max-entropy
 
The entropy of grayscale image is statistical measure of randomness that can be used to characterize the texture of the input image. It is used to describe the business of an image, i.e. the amount of information which must be coded for by a compression algorithm. This method use the derivation of the probability distribution of gray-levels to define the entropies and then find the maximum information between the object and the background - the entropy maximum, the threshold value[^KAP1985].
 
Program summary:
 
1. Determine the normalized histogram, and then calculate the cumulative normalized histogram.
2. Determine the first and the last non-zero bin.
3. Calculate the entropy of the background pixels and the entropy of object pixels.
4. Add these two entropy to get the total entropy for each gray-level and find the threshold that maximizes it.
 
 ### Otsu
 
Otsu method is a non-parametric and unsupervised method of automatic threshold selection for picture segmentation. The algorithm assumes that the image contains two classes of pixels following bimodal histogram[^GLAS1993] (foreground pixels and background pixels),and search for the threshold that minimizes the intra-class variance (weighted sum of variances of the two classes)[^OTS1979]. The aim is to find the threshold value where the sum of foreground and background spreads is at its minimum.
 
Program summary:
 
1. Compute histogram and probabilities of each intensity level.
2. Set up initial class probability and initial class means.
3. Step through all possible thresholds maximum intensity.
4. Compute between class variance.
5. Desired threshold corresponds to the maximum value of between class variance.
 
 ## Results
 
A benchmarking has been used to compare the methods. It uses the performance.now() method returning a DOMHighResTimeStamp, measured in milliseconds, accurate to five thousandths of a millisecond (5 microseconds). 
The results are in millisecond and represent the mean of 100 iterations of the method after 100 iteration to warming it up. It compares the method according to the size of an image (1 "lena" to 10 "lenas") and to two web browsers : Firefox (Quantum 57.0.2 64bits) and Chrome (63.0.3239.84 64bits).

 The two implemented methods are faster on Firefox than on Chrome. The result are also less fluctuating on Firefox(Figure 1).

</figure>

The second method implemented is faster than the first (10 times faster on a 512*512 pixels image to 50 times faster on a image with 10x more pixels)(Figure 2).

The number of loop turn is only correlated to the k-number and not to the image size(Figure 3).

</figure>

The loading of the Raster in the method takes around 75% of the time of the method(Figure 4).

Bilevel thresholding and multilevel thresholding can be done with k-means clustering. The left image is the original, then it is a bilevel thresholding, then 3 clusters k-means (so 2 thresholds, 3 shades of grey) and finally 9 clusters k-means(Figure 5).

</figure>

The figure 6 show that the obtained results from benchmarks are very variables, it's very surprising. Indeed, we can observe that the execution times globally increases with the the image size increasing. However, we can also observes that the execution with biggest size images is sometimes faster with small pictures. Another benchmark with increasing size images is proportional did not show any variability in the results. An exponential curve is observed, which has been expected (Figure 7).

A threshold was made with an 8 bits and 16 bits image(Figure 8).

### Max Entropy

The figure below show the result given by ImageJâs function Auto-threshold which uses Max entropy method,and the maxEntropy() function implemented in javascript. We can see that we obtain similar results (Figure 9).

The results of benchmark for maxEntropy() function show two things.

### Otsu

The two pictures below show the result given by ImageJâs[^RUE2017] function Auto-threshold which uses Otsu method,and our otsu() function[^RID1978]. We can see that we obtain quite similar results(Figure 10).


<figure>
    <img src="(https://github.com/rmy17/bioinf-struct/blob/master/projectThreshold/images/blobsmercia.png)" alt="Image" />
    <center><figcaption>Figure 10: Results of otsu method. on the left: original image, in the middle: output of our function, on the right: output of ImageJ Threshold.</figcaption></center>
</figure>

The result of our benchmark for our function for images uint8 shows us the expected result: the otsu() function is the fastest. the function takes longer as the image grows. We can also see that the differences between the two browsers are firefox and chrome, as we increase the size of the input image, the algorithm takes three more times the execution time.This result was expected for otsu because its algorithm  operates on histograms (which are integer or float arrays of length 256), it's quite fast unlike adaptive threshold for example(Figure 11).

## Discussion

All the functions can handle the processing of pictures up to 2024x2024 pixels and maybe higher, and two types : uint8, uint16.

### K-means

Two implementations have been designed. The first one, as proposed in the program summary, following a direct description of the k-means clustering, has to read through each pixel of the image multiples times, to label them and to compare new and old label to each other. It is getting slower the bigger the image is.

The second method has be designed to improve the speed of the program. This implementation takes advantage of the histogram of the image and only has to read through 256 values at maxima for a 8-bit image - 65535 for a 16-bit image - when computing centroids or labelling each pixel with a cluster. A initialization step has been added to compute the histogram of the image.

### Adaptive threshold

The adaptive threshold algorithm is a local thresholding method. So, there is an path throughout of the image. For this reason, this algorithm is slowness than other global thresholding algorithm which used the histogram. But the strong variabilities obtained are difficult to explain. This may come from the kernel calculation method even if we get a correct curve with proportional size images.

### Max Entropy

The max entropy tresholding method implemented in javascript and the one of ImageJ send similar results in terms of output image quality. However the ImageJ plugin are faster in terms of execution speed. That can be explain by the fact that the ImageJ method are encoded in Java, a language more adapted to this type of program.

### Otsu

We were able to compare our results for the otsu method with the otsu function of ImageJ, we get the same results in terms of output image quality but the ImageJ plugin at a much faster execution speed. However, it was expected that our function is surpassed by ImageJ and its plugin because they are encoded in Java, a language more powerful than JavaScript.

## Conclusion

All the scripts works correctly and for those that can be compared to ImageJ functions, the results are identical. As planned, javascript in a web browser is slower than java compiled code in ImageJ. However these versions in javascript will allow to potentially make a web interface to use these with an Internet grader.
