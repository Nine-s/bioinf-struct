## Introduction 

Image segmentation segments a digital image based on a certain characteristic of the pixels is a well-known technique. The goal is to turn a grayscale image into a binary image, classifying each pixel into one of two categories, such as "dark" or "white". The most basic threshold technique is to choose a threshold value and compare each pixel to that value. Starting of this principle, many of thresholding methods have been developed. Among them, there are two main categories :  global thresholding, where a single threshold is used throughout the image to be divided into two classes and local thresholding, where the threshold values are determined locally, pixel by pixel or region by region. Three of four algorithm that will be presented Otsu, K-means and Entropie are part of the global thresholding category and are histogram based-methods. While the fourth algorithm, adaptive threshold is part of the local thresholding category and is based on the used of a kernel that runs through the image.
